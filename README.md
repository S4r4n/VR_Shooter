I created a vr game where the player can move around. It is just a simple game, where player has acess to a gun which they shoot at objects around the map. Because it was my first time creating a vr game, i did not want ti make it complex and not being bale to finish the game. There are some cubes at the start, on a table which the player can interact with.
